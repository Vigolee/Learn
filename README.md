# Learn
This is a Maven project. I use this Project to record what I learnt. I divided it into several categories. Every pacakages include different content.
Now there are only two big packages,one is java and the second is design pattern.
java includes concurrent, collection, reflect, proxy, classloader, there will be new content to increase in the future.
Design patter also will be increased in the future, but I would not code all the design patterns here.
In the future, I will add other packages here.
